## HW1 Description:
I followed the Jetpack Compose Tutorial and learned the basics of working with Android Studio.

I added and adjusted an image by:

    1. Importing the wanted image into the project.
    2. Using the 'Image'-function and its 'painter'-parameter to show the imported image.
    3. Using the 'modifier'-parameter to set the correct size and clip the image into a circle shape.

I changed the color and the size of the texts (sender name and the message) 
using the 'Text' -function and its parameters. 
I also used modifiers to make padding and spaces between the texts, 
and the 'Surface' -function to create the text bubble.

I made the contect scrollable by using the 'LazyColumn' -function, 
which took the list of sample messages and showed them all after wrapping them into messagecards.

The clicking was registered by using the 'clickable' -modifier and to remember the current state of the message,
'remember' and 'mutableStateOf' -functions were used. The visible smooth change was done by 
using 'animation' -module and its functions and modifiers. 
Once a click has registered the message expands and changes its color, depending on the state of the message. 

All in all, following the tutorial went smoothly and I understood the basic idea of how to use Android Studio.
